*Docker Volumes Readme*

*Problem Statement*

Docker containers are ephemeral, meaning they can be deleted at any time, taking all important files with them. This poses a significant challenge for persisting data across container restarts or deletions.

*Solution*

To address this issue, Docker provides two solutions: Bindmounts and Volumes. While Bindmounts bind a container directory to a host directory, Docker Volumes offer a more robust and flexible solution.

*Why Volumes?*

Volumes provide a logical separation from the container's filesystem, ensuring data persistence across container restarts and deletions. They offer:

- Better lifecycle management through Docker CLI
- No need to specify host directories
- Easy portability and sharing
- High performance
- Compatibility with external storage solutions like EC2, S3, etc.

*Docker Volume Commands*

- *Create Volume*: `docker volume create <volume_name>`
- *Delete Volume*: `docker volume rm <volume_name>`
- *List Volumes*: `docker volume ls`
- *Inspect Volume*: `docker volume inspect <volume_name>`
- *Remove Unused Volumes*: `docker volume prune`

*Example Usage*

1. Build a Docker image: `docker build -t my_image .`
2. Create a volume: `docker volume create my_volume`
3. Run a container with the volume: `docker run -d --name my_container -v my_volume:/app/data my_image`
4. Verify volume usage: `docker inspect my_container`

By using Docker Volumes, you ensure data persistence and flexibility in your containerized applications. Remember to choose Volumes over Bindmounts for a more robust solution.
